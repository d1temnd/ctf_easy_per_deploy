### 4. Performance Benchmarks

- Measure container deployment time
- Measure cleanup batch processing time
- Measure database operation latency

- Establish baselines for acceptable performance

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Testing Tools and Frameworks

- **PyTest**: Primary test framework for Python unit and integration tests
- **Docker SDK for Python**: For Docker integration tests
- **Locust**: For load testing the web interface
- **Prometheus**: For metrics collection during tests
- **PyTest-Mock**: For mocking external dependencies
- **Coverage.py**: For measuring test coverage
- **Postman/Newman**: For API testing

### Mock Objects and Fixtures

- Create Docker client mock for testing container operations without actual Docker
- Create database connection mock for testing database operations
- Create fixtures for common test data (users, containers, etc.)
- Create environment fixtures for different configuration scenarios

### Testing Environment

1. **Local Development Environment**: Individual developers run unit tests
2. **CI Pipeline Environment**: All tests run on each commit
3. **Staging Environment**: Full system tests before production deployment
4. **Production-like Environment**: Performance testing with realistic data volumes

## Test Cases Development Priorities

1. Critical Path Tests
   - Container deployment and cleanup
   - Database connection management
   - Rate limiting functionality
   - Error handling for critical operations

2. Edge Case Tests
   - Behavior at maximum capacity
   - Recovery from various failure scenarios
   - Handling malformed inputs
   - Race conditions in concurrent operations

3. Performance Tests
   - Baseline performance metrics
   - Regression detection
   - Scaling characteristics

## Implementation Guidelines

### Unit Test Implementation

- Each module should have its own test file
- Tests should be independent and not rely on external state
- Use parameterized tests for testing multiple similar scenarios
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Include both positive and negative test cases

### Integration Test Implementation

- Set up isolated test environments with Docker Compose
- Use test databases rather than production databases
- Mock external services when possible
- Clean up all resources after tests
- Include error handling and timeout scenarios

### Continuous Integration Setup

- Run unit tests on every commit
- Run integration tests on pull requests and main branch commits
- Run full system tests before releases
- Archive test artifacts for debugging failed tests
- Monitor test durations and optimize slow tests

## Specific Test Scenarios

### 1. Centralized Cleanup Manager Tests

- Test cleanup of 1, 10, 50, 100 expired containers
- Test cleanup when some containers are already removed
- Test cleanup when database is slow/degraded
- Test cleanup when Docker API is slow/degraded
- Test concurrent cleanup operations
- Test proper error handling for container removal failures
- Test resource usage during large cleanup operations

### 2. Connection Pool Tests

- Test connection acquisition under normal load
- Test connection acquisition under heavy load
- Test proper connection release after operations
- Test connection reuse
- Test behavior when pool is exhausted
- Test connection timeouts
- Test connection error handling
- Test pool metrics reporting

### 3. Rate Limiting Tests

- Test single IP under rate limit
- Test single IP at rate limit boundary
- Test single IP exceeding rate limit
- Test multiple IPs approaching global limits
- Test rate limit restoration after time window
- Test rate limit persistence across application restarts

### 4. Web Interface Tests

- Test container deployment via web interface
- Test container management (restart, stop, extend)
- Test error handling and user feedback
- Test CAPTCHA validation
- Test session management and user identification
- Test admin interface and metrics display

## Test Reporting and Monitoring
